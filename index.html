    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Elm Capital Partners is a private equity investment firm focused on acquiring and operating businesses with revenue ranging from $5M - $150M with a goal of growing such businesses through long range planning, application of relevant industry best practices, investments in growth initiatives, and careful stewardship of financial performance. We are not limited to any particular industry nor geographic region; instead, our target companies are primarily ones we believe to have a potential for growth and include companies that may be undergoing some element of transition.</p>
    <p>The fine balance between challenging the status quo, regardless of a companyâ€™s stage, and keeping a clear focus on proven revenue drivers, is a core value that we employ when operating and strategically positioning a business. Through this lens, Elm Capital Partners seeks to drive continuous improvement to generate long-term growth and maximize value.</p>
    <p>Another equally important core value is our focus on value-creating initiatives and operational improvements. Consequently, the execution of such strategy and focus is on lock-step collaboration with existing leadership and will require creativity, unique solutions, strong partnership, mutual respect and accountability, and a clear line of honest and candid communication among the management team.</p>
    <p>All in all, Elm Capital Partners aims to work in partnership with successful management teams to grow and responsibly develop businesses with a long-term view.</p>
